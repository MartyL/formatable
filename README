Installing Manually:
--------------------

There are several different parts to this application. All paths are relative to your site's
root path. For more help please use the BBS http://bbs.face2interface.com/.

**note http://face2interface.com/cgi-bin/FormATable/index.cgi?display is the link to display


Script Changes:
---------------

1)	index.cgi

#!/usr/local/bin/perl		this is the path to Perl on your server; change it if necessary
use lib '###root path###/perllib/FormATable';		replace with the server root path

2)	FormATable.pm

use Flat();			# or
use DB();

One of these two lines should be removed or commented out. Depends on whether you have available
a Mysql database to use for the FormATable application or not. If not, use Flat(); which will 
store the data on a flat file.

my $db	= new Flat;		# or
my $db	= new DB;

Keep the one needed, so that it matches the 'use' line above.



	&Utl::sendMail
	({	
		to		=>	'marty',
		from	=> 'Face 2 Interface', 
		subj	=> "$ENV{HTTP_HOST} FormATable Entry Added",
		body	=> $msg 													
	})

These lines will create an email notifying you when new data has been added. Adjust as needed.


3)	DB.pm - if you use a Mysql database then this line must be changed appropriately

my $dbh = DBI->connect('DBI:mysql:FormATable:localhost','formatable','secret-password')


4)	Utl.pm - change the root path, same as you did  on index.cgi

sub root { '###root path###/' }				#	root server path

my $mail = '/usr/local/bin/sendmail'; - change to your server's path to sendmail, if different



In addition you may wish to modify the meta-tags for description, keywords, and author.
The form is now set up with a small number of commonly used fields which may be changed
in any way you see fit. There is also CSS in an external stylesheet which you may wish to
change to fit more into your own site's layout.
